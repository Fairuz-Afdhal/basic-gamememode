## West Java Cops and Robbers v3

WJCNR v3 is version 3 of WJCNR, the goal is to make the gamemode up to date with current programming styles and using sampctl. Currently the gamemode is not playable, the goal is to make it compile smoothly.

# Compiling
Run the gamemode using sampctl.
```bash
sampctl package ensure
sampctl package build
sampctl package run
```
